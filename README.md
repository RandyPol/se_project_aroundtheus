**Intro**
  
This project is called “Around The U.S.,” which strictly follows the requirements based on a Figma design for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px). The webpage is responsive to the browser window’s width, preventing horizontal scrolling. So all popular screen sizes will be displayed correctly. 

**Key Technique Used**

The project used different techniques to achieve the Figma requirements. In particular, in places where the text was too long for the container’s width, which resulted in a block overflow, we accounted for this using the CSS properties text-overflow: ellipsis. Further, we added the white space to “nowrap” and the overflow to hidden. By doing this, our project was able to adapt to the browser’s width without any text overflow.
